# PickUp

Our team plans to build an android app that will allow people to connect with fellow 

athletes and plan pick up sporting events.  Users will be able to create unique accounts to 

author events, RSVP, select favorites (which would include sports, location, time, and age 

filters), and view a calendar of their upcoming games.  We will let users login to our app with 

Facebook, and utilize the Google Maps API to display created pickup events. Our app will make 

it easier to connect local athletes and plan pickup games with others who share similar active 

interests.
